## Brief
The app connects local farmers directly to consumers for sustainable, transparent and ethical food supply chains. The app allows farmers to upload their inventory, consumers to place orders, and facilitates direct communication and payment between them.

## Description
The farmer-consumer app is a mobile application designed to connect farmers with consumers directly. The app aims to eliminate intermediaries and provide a platform for farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers. The app will have features that allow farmers to upload information about their crops, prices, and location, and consumers can search for farmers near their location and purchase produce directly from them.

## Objective
The main objective of the farmer-consumer app is to create a direct link between farmers and consumers. By eliminating intermediaries, farmers can earn a better price for their crops, and consumers can purchase fresh produce at a lower cost. The app also aims to promote sustainable farming practices and support small-scale farmers who may not have access to traditional markets.
Features:

1. Farmer profiles: Farmers can create profiles on the app, which will include information such as their location, the types of crops they grow, and their pricing.

2. Consumer profiles: Consumers can create profiles on the app, which will include their location and preferences.

3. Location-based search: Consumers can search for farmers near their location using the app's location-based search feature.

4. Direct communication: Farmers and consumers can communicate directly through the app's messaging feature, which allows them to discuss pricing, availability, and delivery.

5. Online transactions: The app will have a secure payment gateway that will allow consumers to make online payments for their purchases.

6. Reviews and ratings: Consumers can rate and review farmers based on their experience with them, which will help other consumers make informed decisions.

7. Farmer education: The app will also have a section dedicated to farmer education, which will provide information on sustainable farming practices, crop management, and other relevant topics.

8. News and updates: The app will provide farmers with news and updates on weather conditions, crop prices, and other relevant information.

9. Target audience: The target audience for the farmer-consumer app includes small-scale farmers who have difficulty accessing traditional markets and consumers who are interested in buying fresh produce directly from farmers. The app will be available in both urban and rural areas.
    
10. Challenges: One of the major challenges in developing the farmer-consumer app will be to ensure that farmers have access to smartphones and the internet. The app may also face resistance from intermediaries who currently control the supply chain. The app will need to ensure that the quality of the produce is maintained during transportation and delivery.
